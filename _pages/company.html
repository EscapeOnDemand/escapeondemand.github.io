    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Escape On Demand was founded with a lofty objective: to offer large groups the opportunity to participate in escape rooms which were previously reserved for groups no larger than 40 members.</p>
    <p>There was also a lack of alternative team-building options.</p>
    <p>We created Escape On Demand to provide an alternative that focused on the essentials of team-building.</p>
