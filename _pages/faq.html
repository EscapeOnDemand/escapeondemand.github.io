    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">Who is it for?</dt>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">What if we don't know what to do next?</dt>
    <dd class="ml0">Teams can reach out for help at any time using the walkie talkies provided to them. We offer each team up to 3 free hints, so use them wisely.</dd>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">What if 3 hints aren't enough for us to escape?</dt>
    <dd class="ml0">Upon request, we may provide additional hints to a team to ensure an enjoyable experience but each additional hint will add three minutes to your final time.</dd>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">What if we don't escape in time?</dt>
    <dd class="ml0">No worries, not everyone will escape. At the conclusion of the hour, a game master will be available to answer any questions regarding the room and its puzzles.</dd>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">Will we be locked in the room?</dt>

    <dd class="ml0">Photos and videos may be taken outside of the escape rooms. But upon entering a room we ask that you do not take photos or videos. We want to make sure the mysteries are kept secret so everyone who comes has fun!</dd>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">How many people can play?</dt>
    <dd class="ml0">We offer a flexible plan that can handle anywhere from 20 to 160 participants in one session.</dd>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">How long will the experience last?</dt>
    <dd class="ml0">The entire experience will normally take 1.5 to 2 hours but may vary depending on the options you've requested. The game itself lasts one hour, and we will provide a video briefing before the game starts.</dd>

    <dt class="f4 fw6 mb1 mt4 lh-title">Are games physically demanding?</dt>
