    <p>You are turning reports in to your boss's office at the end of the day when the door shuts and locks behind you. You know he has a spare key hidden somewhere in his office but he is a bit eccentric and used a series of puzzles to keep it hidden. To make matters worse you only have one hour to get out and make it to happy hour on time.</p>
