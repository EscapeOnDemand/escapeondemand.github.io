During a voyage back to England, a terrible storm arises and the HMS Remedy is forced to anchor at a deserted island. A treasure map is found ashore and the Captain allows his men to search until the seas clear. When the weather breaks and the Captain gives his order to make for England, some of the crew want to search longer and mutiny. They chain the Captain in the hold and lock you and the rest of those loyal to him in his cabin while they go ashore to search for the treasure. You have one hour to escape before they come back and check on you.
